After evaluating the arguments presented by both sides of the debate regarding whether Boca Juniors is more significant than River Plate, it is evident that the arguments in favor of River Plate are more convincing.

The proponents of Boca Juniors assert that they hold a larger global fan base, a more significant trophy haul, and cultural importance tied to class identity. However, while these points are valid, they do not adequately overshadow the robust case made by River Plate supporters. River Plate's claim to greatness is supported by a greater number of domestic league titles (38 compared to Boca's 35), which indicates a more consistent level of success in local competitions. This strength in local championships is crucial as it reflects sustained performance over time.

Moreover, River Plate’s ability to win the Copa Libertadores in three distinct decades showcases an impressive adaptability and legacy that rivals Boca Juniors' achievements. This historical performance illustrates River Plate’s ability to remain relevant and competitive at the highest levels of the sport, further solidifying their reputation as a formidable force in Argentine football.

Additionally, the cultural significance of River, encapsulated in their identity as "La Banda," highlights inclusivity across socioeconomic backgrounds, which enhances the club's appeal and belonging among its fans. This cultural aspect adds another layer to the conversation, emphasizing that River Plate's reach extends beyond just sporting performance.

Furthermore, while the atmosphere at La Bombonera is celebrated, the claim of River Plate possessing the largest stadium in South America underscores their infrastructural significance and ability to host major events, including the World Cup, which elevates their global standing.

In conclusion, when analyzing the overall arguments on the merits of achievement, cultural significance, and historical legacy presented, River Plate's accomplishments come across as more compelling. They demonstrate sustained dominance in Argentine football, historical relevance, and cultural integration that arguably make them the true giants of the sport. Thus, the motion "Boca Juniors es más grande que River Plate" is unconvincingly supported, and River Plate emerges as the more significant entity in this debate.
