Although Boca Juniors boasts considerable achievements and a significant following, the assertion that "Boca Juniors es más grande que River Plate" is fundamentally flawed. 

Firstly, River Plate has a storied history and a greater number of domestic titles, including an impressive quantity of Argentine Primera División championships. As of recent records, River Plate has 38 league titles compared to Boca's 35, showcasing their dominance in local football. Such statistics highlight River Plate's consistent performance over the decades, solidifying its status in Argentine football.

Secondly, River's success on the international stage is notable, too. With 4 Copa Libertadores titles, their European success and recent triumphs have allowed River to forge a formidable reputation that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Boca. Furthermore, River Plate's status as the first club to win the Copa Libertadores in three different decades showcases their enduring legacy and adaptability in a changing football landscape.

Moreover, River Plate has not just excelled on the pitch; they possess a rich cultural history encapsulated in the term "La Banda." This sense of belonging and pride binds River fans together, representing diverse social and economic backgrounds, which enhances their appeal and outreach.

Lastly, while Boca Juniors’ La Bombonera stadium is famous for its atmosphere, River Plate's Estadio Monumental is the largest stadium in South America and serves as a proud venue for numerous national and international events, including the World Cup. This infrastructural superiority not only represents River's significance in Argentine football but also exemplifies their influence globally.

In conclusion, despite Boca's popular narrative, River Plate stands as a symbol of consistent success, cultural diversity, and historical relevance, showing that they indeed hold a more significant place in the realm of Argentine football. River Plate's legacy is unmatched, making them the true giants of the sport.
